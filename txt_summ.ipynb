    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas.

Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

      "The speech is a reflection of Kalam's experiences and interactions with people from various walks of life during his tenure as President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and acknowledged it as thoughtful. They assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the aspirations of India's youth to live in a developed and prosperous country. The speaker notes that this desire is reflected in the thoughts and dreams of the 540 million youth in India, and that their aspirations should guide the country's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also emphasizes the importance of empowering villages, citing an example from Nagaland where a village council was given financial powers and was able to make decisions and develop the village. The speaker believes that if all villages are empowered to deal with their own development and are well-connected with urban areas, a transformation can take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speech mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) complex, which aims to provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities to 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This initiative has led to the creation of health care centers, educational institutions, and vocational training centers, resulting in large-scale employment generation and the creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban-Rural Action) project in Thanjavur district, India. The project has generated employment and created entrepreneurs by supporting 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been developed into cultivable land, and villagers are engaged in various activities such as farming, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing. The project has also enabled villagers to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of Japanese experts. The speaker believes that similar PURA projects are needed across the country, with a goal of establishing 7000 such projects to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. Firstly, they mention a visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan where they met over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories, who showed great interest in the various gardens, including Mughal, Herbal, and Bio-diesel gardens. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is a personal anecdote about meeting a person named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs, but was incredibly positive and confident. When asked what the speaker could do for him, he replied that he just wanted to sing in front of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring stories. Firstly, they talk about a physically challenged individual who has a talent for music. Despite his disability, he has been encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others to pursue his passion. He has even performed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan art theatre, showcasing his talent and inspiring others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker shares their experience visiting Urusa village in Jammu and Kashmir after a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage and loss, the villagers have shown remarkable resilience and courage in overcoming their challenges. The speaker praises the villagers for not allowing their problems to become their master, but instead becoming the master of their problems themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences with courage in the face of calamities. The author shares two personal anecdotes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. During a visit to a village affected by an earthquake, the author saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces, and even witnessed the settlement of relief grants by the Chief Justice and State Government authorities.\n",
      "2. In 2005, the author visited Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, and was touched by the courage of the tribal islanders who had taken in affected victims as their own, without creating orphanages. The author composed a poem, \"Sea Waves,\" which was sung with enthusiasm by the villagers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author also mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in 2004, but the summary only includes the first two anecdotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a high-speed internet network connecting 53 African countries at an estimated cost of $100 million. The network will connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project for tele-education and tele-medicine has already been launched in Ethiopia, with students from two Ethiopian universities taking an MBA course online and a hospital in India providing medical consultations remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be delivered by a high-ranking official, likely the Prime Minister of India. The speaker highlights two main points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. India's contributions to Africa: The speaker mentions that India has been providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Ethiopia's Black Lion Hospital since 2006, using the Pan African network to connect with 53 African countries. This is an example of India's efforts to bring technological benefits to the African continent.\n",
      "2. Defence and security: The speaker expresses pride in India's Defence Forces, who are vigilant and dedicated to their duties, even in challenging circumstances. The speaker also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in ensuring the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speaker mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform young citizens into enlightened leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh to become enlightened citizens. The speaker shares a personal experience of witnessing the transformation of students in Medak district, where they have shown improvement in self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of responsibility towards the nation. The speaker also shares a specific example of a student leader who was able to inspire her father to quit smoking after participating in a training camp. The speaker believes that empowering youth through value-based education and leadership is crucial, and that the 540 million youth below the age of 25 have the potential to be a powerful resource for the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, while also working towards economic growth and development. They acknowledge the country's progress in the last 60 years and its vast natural resources, as well as the power of its 540 million youth. The speaker encourages citizens to constantly strive to empower others and to aim high, citing a famous poem that suggests that anything one desires can come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then outlines a distinctive profile for a developed India 2020, with the following goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable distribution and access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Harmony between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Education with a value system available to all meritorious candidates regardless of societal or economic discrimination\n",
      "5. India becoming the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech encourages Indians to work together to build a developed nation, focusing on preserving its cultural heritage while also driving economic growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is outlining their vision for an ideal nation, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Everyone has access to the best healthcare\n",
      "* The government is responsive, transparent, and free of corruption\n",
      "* Poverty and illiteracy are eliminated, and crimes against women and children are absent\n",
      "* The society is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with a sustainable growth path.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, the speaker envisions a nation that is equitable, prosperous, and just, where all citizens have access to basic needs and live in harmony with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude to the citizens of India for their love and support over the past five years. He emphasizes that India is one of the best places to live in and takes pride in its leadership. Kalam shares his personal mission to connect the hearts and minds of all Indians, instilling confidence that \"we can do it\". He concludes by reaffirming his commitment to making India a developed nation by 2020, and ends with a blessing and a call to \"Jai Hind\" (Victory to India).\n",
